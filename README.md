## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a daily planner application designed to make your work time management more effective. It allows you to save events for each hour of the day, specifically for standard business hours, i.e., from 9AM to 5PM. The events persist across browser sessions, so you don't lose your schedule upon refreshing or reopening the page. Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they represent past, present, or future times, offering a clear visual cue for your schedule.

## Features

1. Current day display at the top of the calendar.
2. Time blocks for standard business hours.
3. Past, present, and future times are color-coded.
4. Click on a time block to enter an event.
5. A save button for each time block to save the input text.
6. User input is stored in local storage.
7. Saved events persist across page refreshes.

## Installation

To install the application, clone the GitHub repository and simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
